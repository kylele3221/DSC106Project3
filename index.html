      <h2>How does precipitation variability change between SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios?</h1>

      <h1>
        What is SSPs? What is the difference between SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5?
      </h1>

      <p>
        In climate modeling, SSP stands for Shared SocioEconomic Pathway. Each SSP scenario has two parts:
      </p>
      <p>
        - A socioeconomic storyline (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        - A forcing level by 2100 (the number after the ~ , like 2.6, 4.5)
      </p>

      <p>
        Together they describe a future world + its resulting climate impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        SSP1-2.6 is the best-case realistic scenario, where we focus on green technology, education, health, and sustainability. Population growth will be low, and our society will follow green policies to reduce fossil fuels. SSP2-4.5 is a scenario where current policies continue, emissions stabilize, but don't drop, and there are some slow green transitions. In short, SSP2-4.5 shows how our world will be if we continue to live like we do.
      </p>

      <p>Below, we have created an interactive world map showing how precipitation rates change between SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5. Feel free to hover, toggle, and slide over the different interactive components of the map.</p>

        <h2>Design Decision Rationale</h2>

        <p>
          Our group decided to improve our chosen visualization from our checkpoint. Our checkpoint initially showed two SSPs side by side and by moving a toggle, viewers would be able to see the precipitation rates change for both SSPs. However, we felt that this wasn’t interactive enough, and by putting the two visualizations side by side, it would be hard to directly compare a specific part of the map. So, we decided to use a slider, and overlap the two SSP scenarios. We also made the colors of the visualization more vibrant and variant reflecting the feedback from our checkpoint that our visualization difference is not super apparent. Along with our map visualization, we decided to add in a line graph showing both SSP scenarios, with their average precipitation rates per every 5 years, just to add an extra interactive element which can provide a very straightforward view of the whole data. We also consider creating a selection tool like we did in Lab 6 on top of the map, but decided not to because the element overlapped with our point size technique.

        <h2>Overview of the Development Process</h2>

        <p>
          Our development process involved first getting familiarized with our CMIP-6 dataset. This included exploring the relevant features, interpreting variables, and querying the dataset in order to lead us towards our driving question — how does the global mean precipitation change from 2015 to 2100 according to the ssp126 model (i.e., assuming the trajectory of climate change continues as it is presently without any significant intervention) versus the ssp245 model (i.e., the best-case intervention scenario). The data were filtered to include those produced by the NCAR institution's CESM2-WACCM model. This exploration and filtering part was done by all three team members. Thoroughly understanding what dataset we were dealing with and how best to communicate the most relevant aspects of it took roughly 2 hours of group effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there on, we identified potential visualization techniques to include in our interactive plot. Broadly, this included:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adding a map with a slider overlay to contrast the difference in mean precipitation predicted by the two ssp scenarios across separate regions of the globe (effort led by Minyoung).</li>
          <li>Dynamically updating the changes in precipitation over the map based on a timeline functionality (effort led by Kyle).</li>
          <li>Creating a selection tool that allowed visualizing the line trends according to the two scenarios in the mean precipitation at a certain region of the map (effort led by Tanisha). However, this aspect was removed from the final version of the project for the sake of simplicity and in line with the TA’s suggestions to prioritize interpretability over complexity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Since all the aforementioned aspects are interconnected in their functionality, linking them together (and performing multiple debugging iterations) to ensure that the interactive visualization worked as intended took the most time (approximately 8 hours combined).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the final stage, the finishing touches, including CSS modifications and write-ups, were discussed and implemented to make our visualization accessible and intuitive to understand for the average reader.
